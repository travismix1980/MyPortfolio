		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
			Hello, my name is Travis Mix. I have wanted to be a programmer since I was
			15. Before that I wanted to be either a police officer , a pilot, and at
			one point a cowboy.
		</p>

		<p>
			When I turned 15 years old, I found a c++ beginners book and enjoyed every
			minute I spent going through it. It was at this point I discovered what I
			wanted to do especially with the rest of the things I wanted to do made
			impossible by a combination of diabetes and epilepsy. I really did enjoy
			creating something from nothing that I got with programming and stuck with
			it from that time on till now.
		</p>

		<p>
			My favorite programming languages are C++, and C#, and now I find myself
			on a journey of learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the rest of languages
			that make the modern internet exist. At the same time I am also learning
			ASP.Net Core. For fun my favorite things to do is playing board games with
			my family or playing the Tabletop RPG Call of Cthulhu, as well as reading.
			I also enjoy horror, sci-fi, and comedy movies.
